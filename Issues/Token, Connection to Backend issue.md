This is happening while GETting at http://localhost:1337/api

Still this is happening even after giving public to Articles

# Solution:


I see the issue now! You're still getting the IPv6 connection error (`connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:1337`) even though you can access the backend directly. The problem is that you're using `localhost` in your environment variables, but Next.js is trying to connect via IPv6.

Here's the fix:

## 1. Update your `.env.local` file

Change from:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL=http://localhost:1337
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_HOST=localhost
```

To:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1337
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_HOST=127.0.0.1
```

Your full `.env.local` should look like:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAGE_LIMIT=6
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1337
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_HOST=127.0.0.1
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_PROTOCOL=http
STRAPI_API_TOKEN=cedaf0b5597c39de19a580b80125f3815783db29513e6a2fb345cae9453f0b2ff08139d0ffb1959ab69d67f815cc2c2b7e74391bf092a20862a6f02f85f06cd2bd8e021f9585192e4253602c913431090f11483b9a1bc2ebe114680a4b0872640f8a8d787028d9a12d1bf150f8dce0bc056e2a232b35b0470c83bcb228cbd568
```

## 2. Restart your Next.js development server

After changing the environment variables:
```bash
# Stop your current dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
yarn dev
```

## 3. Verify the change worked

Check that your `lib/fetch-api.tsx` is using the environment variable correctly. It should be something like:

```typescript
const API_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL || 'http://127.0.0.1:1337';
```

## 4. Test the connection

Once you restart, try accessing your frontend again. The error should be resolved because:

- `localhost` resolves to IPv6 (`::1`) on your system
- `127.0.0.1` forces IPv4 connection
- Your Strapi server is listening on IPv4 (`0.0.0.0:1337`)

## Why this happens:

- Modern systems often prefer IPv6 over IPv4
- When you use `localhost`, your system tries IPv6 first (`::1:1337`)
- Your Strapi server is configured to listen on IPv4 (`0.0.0.0:1337`)
- The connection fails because there's no IPv6 listener
- Using `127.0.0.1` explicitly forces IPv4 connection

After making this change and restarting your dev server, your frontend should be able to connect to your Strapi backend successfully.
