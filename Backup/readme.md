1. Strapi Self-Hosted (Local or Custom Server)

    Use the Strapi Data Export Command:
    Strapi 5 provides a CLI command to export your entire project data, including the database content, configuration, assets, and schemas.
    Example command:

```bash
yarn strapi export --file my-strapi-export
```

or

```bash
npm run strapi export -- --file my-strapi-export

```



By default, this creates an encrypted and compressed archive. You can disable encryption or compression with --no-encrypt and --no-compress if you want a plain .tar file.


The exported archive will include:

    Project configuration
    All content (entities)
    Relations (links)
    Assets (files in uploads)
    Schemas
    Metadata
    Note: Admin users and API tokens are not exported. Media from third-party providers are not included in the export.
    See more details in the official documentation.


#### Importing:

And for importing 
To import a full backup into your Strapi backend, use the strapi import command. This command restores your content, configuration, assets, and schemas from an archive created by strapi export. Hereâ€™s how to do it:
Basic Import Command

```bash
yarn strapi import -f /path/to/your/export_file.tar.gz.enc
```
